This repository contains the software implementation and statistical analysis of the **Krip lightweight stream cipher**. This project was developed as part of a Bachelor's Thesis at the National Technical University of Ukraine "Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute."

## Project Overview

The main objective of this research is to evaluate the cryptographic quality of the output gamma produced by the Krip algorithm. The analysis is performed using a suite of statistical tests to determine if the algorithm can be considered a reliable pseudo-random number generator (PRNG).

> **Note:** The core research and code were completed in 2023 as part of my Bachelor's thesis. In 2026, the repository was restructured, documented, and updated for better maintainability and clarity.

### Key Features:
  - Full implementation of the **Krip stream encryption algorithm**.
  - Custom-built testing framework for statistical analysis.
  - Implementation of **6 specialized statistical tests** based on the **NIST SP 800-22** methodology.
  - High-performance processing for long sequences of ciphertexts.

### Tech Stack
  - **Language:** C#
  - **Framework:** .NET / Visual Studio
  - **Domain:** Lightweight Cryptography, Statistical Analysis, PRNG

## Statistical Testing
The output of the cipher was tested against the following criteria to ensure security:
  - **Chi-squared ($\chi^2$) Test** – Frequency analysis of bits.
  - **Longest Run of Ones** – Checking for abnormal clusters of identical bits.
  - **Bigram Test** – Frequency analysis of two-bit combinations.
  - **Runs Test** – Total number of runs of ones and zeros.
  - **Sign Change Test** – Analyzing the frequency of transitions between 0 and 1.
  - **Inversion Test** – Evaluating the linear complexity and order of the sequence.

**Result:** 95.6% of the generated sequences successfully passed all tests, confirming high-quality pseudo-random properties.

## Research Results

The statistical analysis proved that the **Krip algorithm** successfully passed all implemented NIST tests. The output gamma sequences showed no significant statistical deviations, confirming its effectiveness as a stream cipher for general-purpose encryption.

Detailed analysis, including p-values and statistical distribution charts, can be found in the full thesis document located in the `/docs` folder.
